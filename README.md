# Arc Movie Recommender

Implementation of a movie recommendation pipeline using [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) data. Inspiration came from [this](https://www.codementor.io/@jadianes/building-a-recommender-with-apache-spark-python-example-app-part1-du1083qbw) article on codementor and the Spark documentation on [collaborative filtering](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-collaborative-filtering.html).

This repo is built on the [arc](https://arc.tripl.ai/) data pipeline framework.

## Setup

Download and unpack data files by running `make download`

## Running

Start the infrastructure by running `docker-compose up`. This will start the Arc Jupyter Notebook service. You can then open Jupyter at [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888).

With the Docker infrastructure running, the first step is to run `src/MovieModel.ipynb` to set up, train, and store the ALS machine learning model for the pipeline to use.

The, open `src/MovieRecommendations.ipynb` to execute the ML model as part of a data pipeline

## Clean Up

Files generated by running the Arc IDE can be cleaned up through running `make clean`.
